Arduino Mega synth project

Schematic: maybe some day

Code works at least roughly. Square wave tones. Room for improvements.
Setting buttons do not work, keys work.

Pet project to practive TDD with arduino stuff.

Based on really good book: 
* [Get Your Legacy C into a Test Harness](https://wingman-sw.com/articles/tdd-legacy-c)

Gradually writing tests etc and separating different things to different modules.


Update 14.7.2024: ABORT ABORT ABORT
No way I am going to get arduino stuff working. Switching to more simple avr stuff instead and let's start from there. It will be a long way....
